# Product Analytics
## Prompt
Over the past year, the company launched TimeForce, a free consumer-facing app designed to help people better manage how they spend their time, both personally and professionally. Although many existing users adopted it, it's available to everyone for free and you don't
have to be an existing customer user to enjoy it. TimeForce is the reason Astro always has time for important things!

The lead PM for TimeForce approaches you and asks for your help. She has a bunch of questions and hopes you can help her get some answers:
1. How is the product doing?
2. What should the lead PM focus on to grow TimeForce adoption?
    a. Should she invest into getting new users or retaining existing users?
    b. Is there a specific type of user that she should focus on?
    c. Any other recommendations?
3. Where should we take the analysis next, and what additional data would you need?
